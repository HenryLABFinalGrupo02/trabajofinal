We have just had too many experiences where we spent way too long waiting. We usually opt for another diner or restaurant on the weekends, in order to be done quicker.       0  mh_-eMZ6K5RLWhZyISBhwA\n","1  7ATYjTIgM3jUlt4UM3IypQ     1  2012-01-03 15:28:18      0  BiTunyQ73aT9WBnpR9DZGw    5.0  I've taken a lot of spin classes over the years, and nothing compares to the classes at Body Cycle. From the nice, clean space and amazing bikes, to the welcoming and motivating instructors, every class is a top notch work out.\\n\\nFor anyone who struggles to fit workouts in, the online scheduling system makes it easy to plan ahead (and there's no need to line up way in advanced like many gyms make you do).\\n\\nThere is no way I can write this review without giving Russell, the owner of Body Cycle, a shout out. Russell's passion for fitness and cycling is so evident, as is his desire for all of his clients to succeed. He is always dropping in to classes to check in/provide encouragement, and is open to ideas and recommendations from anyone. Russell always wears a smile on his face, even when he's kicking your butt in class!       1  OyoGAe7OKpv6SyGZT5g77Q\n","2  YjUWPpI6HXG530lwP-fb2A     0  2014-02-05 20:30:30      0  saUsX_uimxRlCVr67Z4Jig    3.0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Family diner.

We have tried it multiple times, because I want to like it! I have been to it's other locations in NJ and never had a bad experience. \\n\\nThe food is good, but it takes a very long time to come out. The waitstaff is very young, but usually pleasant. We have just had too many experiences where we spent way too long waiting. We usually opt for another diner or restaurant on the weekends, in order to be done quicker.       0  mh_-eMZ6K5RLWhZyISBhwA 2018-07-07 22:09:11\n","1  7ATYjTIgM3jUlt4UM3IypQ     1  2012-01-03 15:28:18      0  BiTunyQ73aT9WBnpR9DZGw    5.0  I've taken a lot of spin classes over the years, and nothing compares to the classes at Body Cycle. From the nice, clean space and amazing bikes, to the welcoming and motivating instructors, every class is a top notch work out.\\n\\nFor anyone who struggles to fit workouts in, the online scheduling system makes it easy to plan ahead (and there's no need to line up way in advanced like many gyms make you do).\\n\\nThere is no way I can write this review without giving Russell, the owner of Body Cycle, a shout out. Russell's passion for fitness and cycling is so evident, as is his desire for all of his clients to succeed. He is always dropping in to classes to check in/provide encouragement, and is open to ideas and recommendations from anyone. Russell always wears a smile on his face, even when he's kicking your butt in class!       1  OyoGAe7OKpv6SyGZT5g77Q 2012-01-03 15:28:18\n","2  YjUWPpI6HXG530lwP-fb2A     0  2014-02-05 20:30:30      0  saUsX_uimxRlCVr67Z4Jig    3.0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Family diner.

Cheese curds were very good and very filling. Really like that sandwiches come w salad, esp after eating too many curds! Had the onion, gruyere, tomato sandwich. Wasn't too much cheese which I liked. Needed something else...pepper jelly maybe. Would like to see more menu options added such as salads w fun cheeses. Lots of beer and wine as well as limited cocktails. Next time I will try one of the draft wines.       1  bcjbaE6dDog4jkNY91ncLQ 2017-01-14 20:54:15"]},"execution_count":52,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["k_review.head()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":46724,"status":"ok","timestamp":1668560897122,"user":{"displayName":"Acidminded","userId":"15042557332774087261"},"user_tz":360},"id":"kYbvlYbBo5US","outputId":"e15f0a55-3cb3-4d06-9ad7-72e6a9e2c2dd"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["Timestamp('2005-02-16 03:23:22')"]},"execution_count":85,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["min_datetime = k_review.datetime.min()\n","min_datetime"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":43170,"status":"ok","timestamp":1668560940281,"user":{"displayName":"Acidminded","userId":"15042557332774087261"},"user_tz":360},"id":"FGF2-hhao8wS","outputId":"c94dd1f3-fa6e-4a4f-b5af-2573dc9158bb"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["Timestamp('2022-01-19 19:48:45')"]},"execution_count":86,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["max_datetime = k_review.datetime.max()\n","max_datetime"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":6,"status":"ok","timestamp":1668560613532,"user":{"displayName":"Acidminded","userId":"15042557332774087261"},"user_tz":360},"id":"weihSKZp9M_4","outputId":"2dfe62d9-4de4-430c-e658-b2f3c2208e59"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["datetime.time(3, 23, 22)"]},"execution_count":83,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["min_datetime.time()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":7,"status":"ok","timestamp":1668560940762,"user":{"displayName":"Acidminded","userId":"15042557332774087261"},"user_tz":360},"id":"MOnwBAPl-FDp","outputId":"a5d3ad43-d99b-4734-dc79-1f8e21fa8fc8"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["datetime.date(2022, 1, 19)"]},"execution_count":87,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["max_datetime.date()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"w2CAqpRUsdul"},"source":["Now we separate the hour and date from the datetime column in different columns"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":29743,"status":"ok","timestamp":1668702432280,"user":{"displayName":"Acidminded","userId":"15042557332774087261"},"user_tz":360},"id":"8OMchTdd71lb","outputId":"4575841e-ff75-4c33-86da-4514512e3eae"},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["/content/spark-3.1.3-bin-hadoop2.7/python/pyspark/sql/pandas/functions.py:392: UserWarning: In Python 3.6+ and Spark 3.0+, it is preferred to specify type hints for pandas UDF instead of specifying pandas UDF type which will be deprecated in the future releases.

We have tried it multiple times, because I want to like it! I have been to it's other locations in NJ and never had a bad experience. \\n\\nThe food is good, but it takes a very long time to come out. The waitstaff is very young, but usually pleasant. We have just had too many experiences where we spent way too long waiting. We usually opt for another diner or restaurant on the weekends, in order to be done quicker.       0  mh_-eMZ6K5RLWhZyISBhwA 2018-07-07 22:09:11    22\n","1  7ATYjTIgM3jUlt4UM3IypQ     1  2012-01-03      0  BiTunyQ73aT9WBnpR9DZGw    5.0  I've taken a lot of spin classes over the years, and nothing compares to the classes at Body Cycle. From the nice, clean space and amazing bikes, to the welcoming and motivating instructors, every class is a top notch work out.\\n\\nFor anyone who struggles to fit workouts in, the online scheduling system makes it easy to plan ahead (and there's no need to line up way in advanced like many gyms make you do).\\n\\nThere is no way I can write this review without giving Russell, the owner of Body Cycle, a shout out. Russell's passion for fitness and cycling is so evident, as is his desire for all of his clients to succeed. He is always dropping in to classes to check in/provide encouragement, and is open to ideas and recommendations from anyone. Russell always wears a smile on his face, even when he's kicking your butt in class!       1  OyoGAe7OKpv6SyGZT5g77Q 2012-01-03 15:28:18    15\n","2  YjUWPpI6HXG530lwP-fb2A     0  2014-02-05      0  saUsX_uimxRlCVr67Z4Jig    3.0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Family diner.

The beauty of working in a small office was that we each took it in turn to phone our group order through and then walk down to pick it up at lunch time, so at least once a week I got to feel like I'd worked off my food. \\n\\nNot quite to the point of queueing round the block yet, this is still a very popular corner shop and you find an unusual variety of builders, suits and students in there. Prices are cheap and staff are efficient - well, they have to be to meet the lunch time rush! A good variety of lunchable munchables means it is easy to understand why this is so popular.       0  xA6GL6xQ-oGBxTa7UMRYAw 2010-04-17 18:16:28\n","4616218  IvQs2hhXKZ4NgZhVZ5jjjQ     0  2010-06-12 11:18:49      0  Lcwp3xHAew7mz9Adh1PMVQ    3.0  Pumpernickles is situated a stones throw away from Langtons sandwich bar and you could make a case for a visit to both. Pumpernickles just like langtons makes a large range of sandwiches and is good for a breakfast sarnie or something a little lighter in the afternoon. Pumpernickles though , from its' name to its decor and signing seems to have a touch more class than Langtons does although the taste of both places produce is very similar. Pumpernickles advertises that it caters for parties and buffets something which as far as I'm aware Langtons does not do. The staff in Pumpernickles are pleasant and the service is quick for waiting customers who often want to grab a quick sandwich and go. Pumpernickles seems to be the slightly more upmarket version of Langtons but unlike Langtons it does not have any outside seating although the shop is slightly larger. I would recommend the BLT at Pumpernickles as I tried it and found it to be perfect, it is a great establishment and one which will provide a top notch barm.\\nIt is only natural to compare Langtons' and Pumpernickles but except for the fact that one caters for parties ect and the decor is different you'll find very little difference and my advice would be to simply visit which every you are nearest to at the time as neither will disappoint.       0  ERyhMwXG1woQbBMuK68ZQg 2010-06-12 11:18:49\n","4685310  IvQs2hhXKZ4NgZhVZ5jjjQ     0  2010-06-24 11:26:30      0  WbRCJLvJdO65sHj1LZfOTw    4.0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Pumpernickles is situated in a vast student area of town which is easy to see why it is so popular not only with students but for office workers and the rest of the public. Every time I walk past here, the shop tends to be full of queue at peak lunch times. \\n\\nThey sell sandwiches galore and a generous choice of salads thus making it a quick lunch stop for busy commuters. A good English breakfast is also available, starting from just £3 which you won't find too greasy. Pumpernickles is generally convenient and affordable, that offers a selection of ingredients to suit everyone.

How very Dickensian. I feel as though Scrooge is going to be working away in the back and the counter staffed by Miss Piggy and Kermit. However, this isn't really the style of the shop just my over-active imagination! (And I know the Muppets weren't in the original A Christmas Carol!) \\n\\nIt's a lovely little sandwich bar on the corner of Mount Pleasant and my favourite part of the service they offer is a little Packed Lunch; you get a sarnie, drink, and either crisps or fruit for £2.50. Well worth the moolah. Tasty, freshand  healthy! \\nMakes me want to buy a Power Rangers lunch box.       0  t-dVBcTV67DqZM5EVy2SVQ 2010-06-10
